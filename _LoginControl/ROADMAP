## Changes to table views
    - Left table view (source list)
        - No longer use the 'Source List' style
        - Do not use grid lines or alternating row colors
            - Grid lines are fugly
            - Alternatiing row colors are used by the Right table view
        - Add a new column to the left of the Title column
            - This column will have no header title
            - Will either contain nothing or a special symbol (green orb?)
            - Indicates whether the list is currently the 'live list'
    - Right table view (files list)
        - Will default to being narrower

## Implementation details
    - Stop using bindings, they really complicate doing anything with tables
    - Use data source, it's really a lot easier than it seemed at first
    - Add Undo support (should be a lot easier when using a data source)
    - Allow dragging and dropping items to reorder them and move/copy them to different lists
    - Change implementation of list items to be source-independent
        - Should not matter whether it's being inserted/deleted to/from a normal array, or the live list
        - Will require a bit of planning to get right
        - Better handling of broken links in all list items
    - Lists will be stored homogeneously in the database
        - All lists will have:
            - Contents
            - Title
            - IsLiveList
        - Live list will be different
            - IsLiveList is True
            - Contents will be empty

## Improving workflow
    - Use a slightly older UI, a la 10.4, since mostly power users will use the app
        - Power users don't really care what a UI looks like
        - New "Leopard" style window won't impress anyone
        - Just looks too ugly and cramped
    - Add menu items for functions, with clearly labeled keyboard shortcuts
        - Left Table
            - New List (Cmd-Shift-N)
            - Duplicate List (Cmd-D)
            - Delete List
            - Make Live List (Cmd-L)
        - Right Table
            - Add Item
            - Delete Item
    - All of the above should also have context menu items
    - Perhaps add a toolbar for the most important actions
        - New List
        - Make Live List
