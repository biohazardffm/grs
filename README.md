## Important Stuff

### AppGrid

- Completely done.
- Can't be sold on the App Store though since it uses Accessibility API.
- 90% of people who've tried it like it way better than SizeUp or Divvy, so market it to compete with them.

### DeskLabels

- Completely done.
- Fits in App Store.
- Has a feature that can't be enabled on the App Store (I tried, Apple rejected it). Find the hidden menu item and unhide it to enable the feature. Then try it out. There's probably a screencast of it in the git history that you can use if you want to sell it outside the App Store.

### Mail Ping

- Completely done.
- Fits in App Store.

### MusicApp

- Unfinished (dead) predecessor to Songs
- Not sure why it's still lying around, maybe it had some cool code I wanted to reuse in Songs

### QuickTimer

- Completely done.
- Fits in App Store.

### Songs

- Unfinished.
- Way cool. Like a simplified iTunes.
- Probably should undo the last commit that affected it (c504c74ad558d0c620f0b324f6703e2cd27782fb), it didn't work out.

### TunesBar

- Completely done.
- Fits in App Store.
- One persone requested option to choose text color. One person. Add it if you wanna make that one anonymous guy happy. Otherwise don't waste your time.

### _BiggerMouse

- Finished, but only prototype
- Should probably add a menu so you don't have to quit it through Activity Monitor
- Also should probably options for different graphics (maybe user-additional ones too)
- And the default one is stupid

### _Docks

- Finished, but only works on 10.5 or something
- Got 4/5 mice on Mac Gems
- Was Apple's download pick for 5 days straight back when they had a downloads page on their site and no Mac App Store

### _ImageConvert

- Not gonna spend money on an .icns app thank you very much.

### _LoginControl

- Doesn't fit on the App store
- Works, but who needs it?

### _SDToolkit

- Internal for the rest of the apps.

### giantrobotsoftware.com

- Really pretty site for the apps. Use `bundle` then `middleman` to build.
