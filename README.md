## Important Stuff

### AppGrid

- Completely done.
- Can't be sold on the App Store though since it uses Accessibility API.
- 90% of people who've tried it like it way better than SizeUp or Divvy, so market it to compete with them.

### DeskLabels

- Completely done.
- Fits in App Store.
- Has a feature that can't be enabled on the App Store (I tried, Apple rejected it). Find the hidden menu item and unhide it to enable the feature. Then try it out. There's probably a screencast of it in the git history that you can use if you want to sell it outside the App Store.

> I found this application after a search for something that would make my life easier when working with my desktop files and folders so I purchased this and what a difference it makes! Just one glance at my labels instead of looking at each individual file or folder title is so much easier. If you have files or folders on your desktop that you would like to label then I would recommend that you give this application a try.

### Mail Ping

> La experiencia general es que funciona. Positivo: - Las notificaciones funcionan bien Negativo: - No se pueden configurar las notificaciones (por ejemplo que sólo cuente mensajes nuevos y no muestre notificaciones) - Muy lento para comprobar - "Go to inbox" y "Go to compose" no funcionan como Google Notifier: necesitas introducir la contraseña en el navegador o estar ya dentro de la cuenta. The general feeling is that It works. Positive: - Notifications working like a charm Negative: - No possibility for configuring notifications (for example, for only counting new messages and not showing notifications) - Very slow to check - Go to inbox and Go to compose don't work like Google Notifier: you do need to enter your password in your browser or being already logged in.

### MusicApp

- Unfinished (dead) predecessor to Songs
- Not sure why it's still lying around, maybe it had some cool code I wanted to reuse in Songs

### QuickTimer

- Completely done.
- Fits in App Store.

### Songs

- Unfinished.
- Way cool. Like a simplified iTunes.
- Probably should undo the last commit that affected it (c504c74ad558d0c620f0b324f6703e2cd27782fb), it didn't work out.

### TunesBar

- Completely done.
- Fits in App Store.
- One persone requested option to choose text color. One person. Add it if you wanna make that one anonymous guy happy. Otherwise don't waste your time.

### _BiggerMouse

- Finished, but only prototype
- Should probably add a menu so you don't have to quit it through Activity Monitor
- Also should probably options for different graphics (maybe user-additional ones too)
- And the default one is stupid

### _Docks

- Finished, but only works on 10.5 or something
- Got 4/5 mice on Mac Gems
- Was Apple's download pick for 5 days straight back when they had a downloads page on their site and no Mac App Store

### _ImageConvert

- Not gonna spend money on an .icns app thank you very much.

### _LoginControl

- Doesn't fit on the App store
- Works, but who needs it?

### _SDToolkit

- Internal for the rest of the apps.

### giantrobotsoftware.com

- Really pretty site for the apps. Use `bundle` then `middleman` to build.
